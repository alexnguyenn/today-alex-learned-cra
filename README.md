***This project is a work-in-progress.***

A simple React app to help me keep track of my notes (programming-related). 
An alternative to messaging to myself in Slack :sweat_smile:

The app is deployed to Surge at [todayalexlearned.surge.sh](https://todayalexlearned.surge.sh). 
Bootstrapped via [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Main tools used:
* [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/): GraphQL Content API for my notes. Very quick and easy to set up. 
* [Apollo Cilent](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/): For working with GraphQL. 
* [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown): For rendering markdown content within React.
