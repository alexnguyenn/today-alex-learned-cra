## Today I Learned
***This project is a work-in-progress.***

A simple React app used for displaying my personal notes. The app is deployed using Surge [here](https://alex-today-i-learned.surge.sh). Bootstrapped by [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Main tools used:
* [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/): GraphQL Content API for my notes. Very quick and easy to set up. 
* [Apollo Cilent](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/): For working with GraphQL. 
* [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown): For rendering markdown content within React.
